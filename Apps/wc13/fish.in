!  GLOSSARY:
!  =========
!
!  This input file provides the initial locations of the float trajectories
!  to compute.
!
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Control Switches.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! Lfloats   Switch to control the computation of floats tracjectories within 
!             nested and/or multiple connected grids. Ngrids values are
!             expected. By default this switch is set to TRUE in "mod_scalars"
!             for all grids when the CPP option FLOATS is activacted. The
!             USER can control which grid to process by turning on/off this
!             switch.
!
! FISHRREC  Flag to indicate re-start from a previous solution.  Use
!             FISHRREC=0 for new solutions. In a re-start solution,
!             FISHRREC is the time index in the floats NetCDF file assigned
!             for initialization. If FISHRREC is negative (say NISHRREC=-1),
!             the floats will re-start from the most recent time record.
!             That is, the initialization record is assigned internally.
!
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Number of floats.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!  NFISH     Number of fish to release in each nested grid.  Provide
!              the exact number of fish.  These values are used to
!              dynamically allocate the arrays in FISHES array structure.
!
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Initial float location KEYWORDS.  The model variable name is not used as
! keyword in some parameters.  However, it namce is provided in brackets.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!  G         Nested grid number [ng].
!
!  C         Initial horizontal location coordinate type [Fcoor]:
!
!              Fcoor = 0,  rho grid units
!                             0.5 =< Fx0 =< Lm(ng)+0.5,
!                             0.5 =< Fy0 =< Mm(ng)+0.5
!
!              Fcoor = 1,  Fx0 is longitude (west values are negative).
!                          Fy0 is latitude (south values are negative).
!
!  T         Float trajectory type [Ftype]:
!
!              Ftype = 1,  neutral density 3D Lagrangian particles.
!
!              Ftype = 2,  isobaric (constant depth) floats.
!
!  N         Number of fish [Fcount] to be released at the (Fx0,Fy0,Fz0)
!              location.  It must be equal or greater than one. If Fcount
!              is greater than one, a cluster distribution of floats
!              centered at (Fx0,Fy0,Fz0) is activated.
!
!              NOTE:  The total number of fish trajectories to compute
!              ====   must add to NFISH. 
!
!  Ft0       Time (days) of fish release after model initialization .
!
!  Fx0       Initial fish x-location (real; grid units or longitude).
!
!  Fy0       Initial fish y-location (real; grid units or latitude).
!
!  Fz0       Initial fish z-location (real; vertical level or depth).
!              If Fz0 is less or equal than zero, Fz0 is the initial
!              depth in meters.  Otherwise, if Fz0 is positive and
!
!                             0 < Fz0 =< N(ng),
!
!              Fz0 is the initial position relative to the W grid
!              (0 = bottom; N = surface).
!
!              WARNING: If the depth in meters at particular horizontal
!                       is not bounded, the fish are released at the
!                       surface.
!
!  Fdt       Float cluster release time interval (real; days), only used
!              if Fcount > 1:
!
!              Fdt = 0,  Fcount fish will be deployed simulataneously
!                        with a distribution centered at (Fx0,Fy0,Fz0)
!                        and defined by (Fdx,Fdy,Fdz).
!
!              Fdt > 0,  a cluster of fish will be deployed from
!                        (Fx0,Fy0,Fz0) at Fdt intervals until Fcount
!                        fish are released.
!
!  Fdx       Cluster x-distribution parameter (real), only used if
!              Fcount > 1 and Fdt = 0.
!
!  Fdy       Cluster y-distribution parameter (real), only used if
!              Fcount > 1 and Fdt = 0.
!
!  Fdz       Cluster z-distribution parameter (real), only used if
!              Fcount > 1 and Fdt = 0.
!
!            NOTE:  the parameters (Fdx,Fdy,Fdz) can be used to specify
!            ====   any type of cluster distribution, for instance:
!
!                   * Lines of fish:
!
!                         Fdx > 0,  Fdy = 0,  Fdz = 0
!                         Fdx = 0,  Fdy > 0,  Fdz = 0
!                         Fdx = 0,  Fdy = 0,  Fdz > 0
!
!             The USER can use any of these parameters to design any
!             cluster distribution in routine "init_fish.F".
